# Welcome to my deposit üòÑ!

Here you'll find the practical work I did following the ‚ÄúDevops in Action‚Äù guide.

## Part 1 - Docker Session

The aim of this part is to implement a three-tier web application, consisting of an HTTP server, a backend API and a database, using Docker containers for each component.

## Structure

The project is divided into three main parts:

-Database (Part 01): This section concerns the configuration and deployment of a PostgreSQL database using Docker. 

-Backend API (Part 02): Here, we deploy a backend API written in Java using Spring Boot. Docker is used to build and run the API.

-HTTP Server (Part 03): This part deals with the deployment of an HTTP server, such as the Apache HTTP Server, to serve a static home page. We also configure this server as a reverse proxy to redirect traffic to our backend API.
